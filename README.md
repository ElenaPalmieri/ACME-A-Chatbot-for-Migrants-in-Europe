# ACME-A-Chatbot-for-Migrants-in-Europe

ACME is a prototypical dialogue system that relies on computational argumentation to aid and orient potential asylum applicants through the asylum application process requirements, helping them identify the highest level of protection they can apply for. The kind of proactive support ACME provides before the formal asylum application process begins is important because in most cases migrants are not familiar with the regulatory framework of international protection. In this way, ACME contributes to a more sustainable migration by reducing the load on territorial commissions, Courts, and humanitarian organizations supporting asylum applicants. Thanks to its modular neural-symbolic architecture and its use of expert-made argumentation-enable reasoning abilities, ACME respects the fundamental principles of data governance and privacy and ensures transparency, auditability, and explainability.
